# General Idea/ Modifications

TOFINSH

Implementation of the lbph algorithm using the lbp features given by scikit-learn. Details of the idea we implemented are written in the python script.

## Structure

- baseModel: where we store the trained model for recognition
- demo.py: script testing the accuracy of our model
- modelV1.py: the implementation 
- prediction: script testing the accuracy of our model
- specimen/test_images: database of images for testing
- __versions__: just previous version of model

## Usage

	python3 demo.py
	./prediction pathToImage
